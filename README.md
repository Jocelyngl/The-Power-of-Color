# The-Power-of-Color
Humans are wired to first be drawn to color when looking at a visualization. 

It is important to make the most of color to indicate importance in our visualizations. To commemorate the fall season this piece of digital art allows the coder to insert their own color preferences to highlight aspects of the leaf. 

Enjoy!
